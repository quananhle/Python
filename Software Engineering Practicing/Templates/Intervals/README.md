## Intervals

### [56. Merge Intervals](https://github.com/quananhle/Python/tree/main/Software%20Engineering%20Practicing/Leetcode/Leetcode%2075/Level%202/Day%2017%20-%20Interval/56.%20Merge%20Intervals)

Given an array of ```intervals``` where ```intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>], merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

__Example__:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

```Python

```
