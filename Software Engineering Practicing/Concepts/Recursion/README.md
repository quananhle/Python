# Recursion

## Principle of Recursion

```Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.```

The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems. The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.
