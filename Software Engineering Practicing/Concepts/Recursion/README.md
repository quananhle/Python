# Recursion

## Principle of Recursion

```Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.```

The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into __subproblems__. The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.

A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:

  1. A simple __base case__ (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
  2. A set of rules, also known as __recurrence relation__ that reduces all other cases towards the base case.

#### Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters ```s```.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

```Python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        def helper(left, right):
            if left >= right:
                return
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            helper(left+1, right-1)
        
        helper(0, len(s)-1)
```

## Recurrence Relation

There are two important things that one needs to figure out before implementing a recursive function:

  - ```recurrence relation```: the relationship between the result of a problem and the result of its subproblems.
  - ```base case```: the case where one can compute the answer directly without any further recursion calls. Sometimes, the base cases are also called bottom cases, since they are often the cases where the problem has been reduced to the minimal scale, i.e. the bottom, if we consider that dividing the problem into subproblems is in a top-down manner.

```Once we figure out the above two elements, to implement a recursive function we simply call the function itself according to the recurrence relation until we reach the base case.```

## Memoization

### Duplicate Calculation in Recursion

This idea is also known as ```memoization```, which is a technique that is frequently used together with recursion.

```
Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
```

## Tips

```
When in doubt, write down the recurrence relationship.
```

```
Whenever possible, apply memoization.
```

```
When stack overflows, tail recursion might come to help.
