# Recursion II

## Divide & Conquer

### D&C Introduction

```Divide and conquer (D&C)``` is one of the __most important__ paradigms in algorithm design and is widely used.

A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly [1]. Then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.
