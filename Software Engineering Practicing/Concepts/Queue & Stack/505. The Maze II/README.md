## [505. The Maze II](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

There is a ball in a ```maze``` with empty spaces (represented as ```0```) and walls (represented as ```1```). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling __up, down, left or right__, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ```m x n``` ```maze```, the ball's ```start``` position and the destination, where $start = [start_{row}, start_{col}]$ and $destination = [destination_{row}, destination_{col}]$, return _the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the ```destination```_. If the ball cannot stop at ```destination```, return ```-1```.

The distance is the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the ```start``` position (excluded) to the ```destination``` (included).

You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).
