For shortest-path problems:
- If graph weights are __equal__: ```Bellman-Ford```, ```Dijkstra's algorithms``` and ```BFS traversal``` are all solutions but the ```BFS``` is the most efficient
- If graph weights are different and all are __positive__: ```Bellman-Ford``` and ```Dijkstra's algorithms``` are solutions but the ```Dijkstra's``` is the most efficient
- If graph weights are different and could be __positive/negative__: ```Bellman-Ford``` algorithms is the only solution betweem the 3 algorithm mentioned here.
