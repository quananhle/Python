## 2. Add Two Numbers

```Tag```: ```List```

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given two __non-empty__ linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in __reverse order__, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
