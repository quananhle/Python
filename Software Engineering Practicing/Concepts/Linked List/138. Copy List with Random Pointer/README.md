## 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

```Tag```: ```Linked List``` ```Hash Table```

#### Difficulty: Medium

A linked list of length ```n``` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or ```null```.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly ```n``` __brand new__ nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the ```next``` and ```random``` pointers of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. __None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list__.

For example, if there are two nodes ```X``` and ```Y``` in the original list, where ```X.random --> Y```, then for the corresponding two nodes ```x``` and ```y``` in the copied list, ```x.random --> y```.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of ```n``` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of ```[val, random_index]``` where:

- ```val```: an integer representing ```Node.val```
- ```random_index```: the index of the node (range from ```0``` to ```n-1```) that the ```random``` pointer points to, or ```null``` if it does not point to any node.
- 
Your code will only be given the ```head``` of the original linked list.

__Example 1:__

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e1.png)
```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

__Example 2:__

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)
```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

__Example 3:__

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)
```
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
```

__Constraints:__
```
0 <= n <= 1000
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
```

### Recursive

```Python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    # Recursive
    #### Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
    #### Space Complexity: O(N), extra memory space to keep up the recursion stack and the visited dictionary
    def __init__(self):
        self.visited = dict()
    
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        
        if head in self.visited:
            return self.visited[head]
        
        node = Node(head.val, None, None)

        self.visited[head] = node

        node.next = self.copyRandomList(head.next)
        node.random = self.copyRandomList(head.random)

        return node
```

### Iterative

1. Traverse the linked list starting at ```head``` of the linked list.
