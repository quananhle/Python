### Operations

Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list in constant time. If we want to get the ith element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one. It takes us ```O(N)``` time on average to ```visit an element by index```, where N is the length of the linked list.

For instance, in the example above, the head is the node 23. The only way to visit the 3rd node is to use the "next" field of the head node to get to the 2nd node (node 6); Then with the "next" field of node 6, we are able to visit the 3rd node.

#### Add Operation - Singly Linked List

If we want to add a new value after a given node ```prev```, we should: 

1. Initialize a new node ```cur``` with the given value;

2. Link the "next" field of ```cur``` to prev's next node ```next```;

3. Link the "next" field in ```prev``` to ```cur```.

Unlike an array, we donâ€™t need to move all elements past the inserted element. Therefore, you can insert a new node into a linked list in ```O(1)``` time complexity, which is very efficient.

#### Add a Node at the Beginning

As we know, we use the head node ```head``` to represent the whole list.

So it is essential to update ```head``` when adding a new node at the beginning of the list.

1. Initialize a new node ```cur```;
2. Link the new node to our original head node ```head```.
3. Assign ```cur``` to ```head```.

For example, let's add a new node 9 at the beginning of the list.

1. We initialize a new node 9 and link node 9 to current head node 23.

2. Assign node 9 to be our new head.
