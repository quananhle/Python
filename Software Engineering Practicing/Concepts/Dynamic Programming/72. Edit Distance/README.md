## [72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

```Tag```: ```Dynamic Programming```

#### Difficulty: Hard

Given two strings ```word1``` and ```word2```, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert ```word1``` to ```word2```_.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

---

__Example 1:__
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

__Constraints:__

- ```0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500```
- ```word1``` and ```word2``` consist of lowercase English letters.

__Edit distance__ is a term used in computer science. By definition, __Edit distance__ is a string metric, a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g. words) are to one another, measured by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

1. "If the two strings are the same, the edit distance is zero".

```word1 = "abcd"```, ```word2 = "abcd"```

Edit Distance = 0
word1 is equal to word2; no need to add, remove or replace any character.

2. "The operations (add/delete/replace) are performed if and only if a character at a certain position in ```word1``` is not equal to the corresponding character in ```word2"```.

```word1 = "abc"```, ```word2 = "abe"```

In this case, we have to perform some operation in ```word1``` to transform it into ```word2```. There are 3 options,

- Option 1 - Delete ```c``` from ```word1```.

- Option 2 - Insert ```e``` into ```word1```.

- Option 3 - Replace ```c``` with ```e``` in word1.

![image](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/Figures/72/all_illustrations.png)

From the above illustrations, it is clear that Option 1 and Option 2 transform ```word1``` to ```word2``` in 2 operations. Thus, the edit distance is 2. And, Option 3 transforms ```word1``` to ```word2``` in just 1 operation, thus edit distance is 1.

Thus, in this case, we will choose Option 3 and the edit distance would be 1.

From this, we can conclude that,

```
Edit distance to transform "word1" to "word2" = 1 + Minimum (Number of operations after deleting e from "word1", 
                                                             Number of operations after inserting c in "word1",
                                                             Number operations after replacing e with c in "word1")
```

__The +1 in the end, is for the current operation.__

### The Framework

1. A function or data structure that will compute/contain the answer to the problem for every given state.

    There are two input strings, ```word1``` and ```word2```. Start by comparing every character in ```word1``` and ```word2```. Let's track the current character index as ```i``` and ```j```. Here, we are comparing the last index of both strings.

2. A recurrence relation to transition between states.

    For every comparison, there are two possibilities,

    - The characters in the current position match

        `word1[i] = word2[j]`

    Move to the next index. No operation is performed.
    
    - The characters in their current position do not match

        `word1[word1Index] != word2[word2Index]`
        
    In this case, we must delete, insert or replace a character in ```word1```. From intuition, we have deduced that we must try all three operations and find the minimum. One of the intuitive ways to implement such problems is by using recursion.
    
        - Replace the character at i in word1 with the character at j in word2.

  **Recurrence Relation**: ```dp(word1, word2, i - 1, j - 1) + 1```
  
        - Inserting the character at word2Index in word2 in word1.

![image](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/Figures/72/insert_illustration.png)

  **Recurrence Relation**: ```dp(word1, word2, i, j - 1) + 1```
  
        - Deleting the character at word1Index in word1.

  **Recurrence Relation**: ```dp(word1, word2, i - 1, j) + 1```

3. Base cases, so that our recurrence relation doesn't go on infinitely.
