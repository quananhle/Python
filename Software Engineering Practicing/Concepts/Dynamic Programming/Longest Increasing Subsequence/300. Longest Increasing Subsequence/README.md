## 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

```Tag```: ```Dynamic Programming``` ```

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an integer array ```nums```, return _the length of the longest __strictly increasing subsequence___.

--- 

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

__Constraints:__

- ```1 <= nums.length <= 2500```
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
