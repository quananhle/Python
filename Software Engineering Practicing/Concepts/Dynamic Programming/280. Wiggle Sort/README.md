## 280. Wiggle Sort

```Tag```: ```Greedy Algorithm``` ```Sorting``` ```Dynamic Programming```

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an integer array ```nums```, reorder it such that ```nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....```

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
Output: [3,5,1,6,2,4]
Explanation: [1,6,2,5,3,4] is also accepted.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [6,6,5,6,3,8]
Output: [6,6,5,6,3,8]
```

__Constraints:__

- 1 <= ```nums.length``` <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= ```nums[i]``` <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input nums.
