We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell (i.e. blue cell).

Given an integer n, return how many distinct phone numbers of length n we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform n - 1 jumps to dial a number of length n. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
