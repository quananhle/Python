## [1125. Smallest Sufficient Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-sufficient-team/)

```Tag```: ```Dynamic Programming```

#### Difficulty: Hard

In a project, you have a list of required skills ```req_skills```, and a list of people. The i<sup>th</sup> person ```people[i]``` contains a list of skills that the person has.

Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in ```req_skills```, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.

- For example, ```team = [0, 1, 3]``` represents the people with skills ```people[0]```, ```people[1]```, and ```people[3]```.

Return _any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person_. You may return the answer in any order.

It is guaranteed an answer exists.
