## 256. Paint House

```Tag```: ```Dynamic Programming```

#### Difficulty: Medium

There is a row of ```n``` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an ```n x 3``` cost matrix ```costs```.

- For example, ```costs[0][0]``` is the cost of painting house ```0``` with the color red; ```costs[1][2]``` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2
```

__Constraints:__

- ```costs.length == n```
- ```costs[i].length == 3```
- ```1 <= n <= 100```
- ```1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20```

### The Framework

#### Top-Down Dynamic Programming (Recursion)

```Python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0

        HOUSES, PAINTS = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(house, paint):
            # Base case
            if not (0 <= house < HOUSES and 0 <= paint < PAINTS):
                return 0

            cost = costs[house][paint]

            # Recurrence relation
            if paint == 0:
                cost += min(dp(house + 1, 1), dp(house + 1, 2))
            elif paint == 1:
                cost += min(dp(house + 1, 0), dp(house + 1, 2))
            else:
                cost += min(dp(house + 1, 0), dp(house + 1, 1))
        
            return cost

        ans = float('inf')
        for paint in range(PAINTS):
            ans = min(ans, dp(0, paint))
        return ans
```

```Python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0

        HOUSES, PAINTS = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        memo = [[0] * (PAINTS + 1) for _ in range(HOUSES + 1)]

        def dp(house, paint):
            # Base case
            if not (0 <= house < HOUSES and 0 <= paint < PAINTS):
                return 0

            if memo[house][paint]:
                return memo[house][paint]

            # Recurrence relation
            if paint == 0:
                memo[house][paint] = min(dp(house + 1, 1), dp(house + 1, 2)) + costs[house][paint]
            elif paint == 1:
                memo[house][paint] = min(dp(house + 1, 0), dp(house + 1, 2)) + costs[house][paint]
            else:
                memo[house][paint] = min(dp(house + 1, 0), dp(house + 1, 1)) + costs[house][paint]

            return memo[house][paint]

        return min(dp(0, 0), dp(0, 1), dp(0, 2))
```

#### Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (Tabulation)

```Python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0

        HOUSES, PAINTS = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        for house in range(HOUSES - 2, -1, -1):
            for paint in range(PAINTS):
                if paint == 0:
                    costs[house][paint] += min(costs[house + 1][1], costs[house + 1][2])
                elif paint == 1:
                    costs[house][paint] += min(costs[house + 1][0], costs[house + 1][2])
                else:
                    costs[house][paint] += min(costs[house + 1][0], costs[house + 1][1])

        return min(costs[0])

```

#### Constant Space Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming 

```Python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total_red, total_blue, total_green = costs[0]
        for red, blue, green in costs[1:]:
            total_red, total_blue, total_green = red + min(total_blue, total_green), blue + min(total_red, total_green), green + min(total_red, total_blue)
        return min(total_red, total_blue, total_green)
```

### Math

Assuming you have a list of consecutive integers in the range, you can use the following formula to get the other numbers:

For the number at index ```i``` in the list, the number before it is at index ```(i-1) % n```, where n is the length of the list. The number after it is at index ```(i+1) % n```.
Using this formula, you can find the other numbers in the range for a given current number. For example, in the range [1,2,3], if the current number is 1, the other numbers are at indices (1+1) % 3 = 2 and (1+2) % 3 = 0, which correspond to 2 and 3 respectively. If the current number is 2, the other numbers are at indices (2+1) % 3 = 0 and (2+2) % 3 = 1, which correspond to 1 and 3 respectively. And if the current number is 3, the other numbers are at indices (3+1) % 3 = 1 and (3+2) % 3 = 2, which correspond to 1 and 2 respectively.

```Python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0

        HOUSES, PAINTS = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        for house in range(HOUSES - 2, -1, -1):
            for paint in range(PAINTS):
                costs[house][paint] += min(costs[house + 1][(paint - 1) % PAINTS], costs[house + 1][(paint + 1) % PAINTS])

        return min(costs[0])
```

```Python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0
            
        HOUSES, PAINTS = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        
        dp = [[0] * (PAINTS) for _ in range(HOUSES)]
        dp[0] = costs[0]

        for house in range(1, HOUSES):
            for paint in range(PAINTS):
                dp[house][paint] = costs[house][paint] + min(dp[house - 1][(paint - 1) % PAINTS], dp[house - 1][(paint + 1) % PAINTS])
                
        return min(dp[-1])
```
