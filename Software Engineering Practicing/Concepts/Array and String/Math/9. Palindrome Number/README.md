__Example 1:__
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

__Constraints:__
