## [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference)

```Tag```: ```Array & String``` ```Counter``` ```Hash Map``` ```Hash Set``` ```Bitwise Manipulations```

#### Difficulty: Easy

You are given two strings ```s``` and ```t```.

String ```t``` is generated by random shuffling string ```s``` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return _the letter that was added to ```t```_.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

__Constraints:__

- $0 \le s.length \le 1000$
- $t.length == s.length + 1$
- ```s``` and ```t``` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Array & String

```Python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s_total = t_total = 0
        for c in s:
            s_total += ord(c)
        for c in t:
            t_total += ord(c)
        
        return chr(t_total - s_total)
```

### Counter

```Python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s_counter, t_counter = collections.Counter(s), collections.Counter(t)
        ans = t_counter - s_counter
        return list(ans)[-1]
```

```Python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s_counter, t_counter = collections.Counter(s), collections.Counter(t)
        ans = t_counter - s_counter
        return tuple(ans)[-1]
```

#### One Liner

```Python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        return tuple(collections.Counter(t) - collections.Counter(s))[-1]
```

### Bitwise Manipulations

```Python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not s:
            return t

        ans = ord(s[0])

        for i, c in enumerate(s[1:] + t):
            ans ^= ord(c)

        return chr(ans)
```
