## 6. Zigzag Conversion

```Tag```: [```String Pattern```](https://github.com/quananhle/Python/tree/main/Software%20Engineering%20Practicing/Concepts/Array%20and%20String/String%20Pattern)

#### Difficulty: Medium

The string ```"PAYPALISHIRING"``` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

And then read line by line: ```"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"```

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

```def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str```
