## [455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

```Tag```: ```String & Array``` ```Two Pointers``` ```Sorting``` ```Greedy```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child ```i``` has a greed factor ```g[i]```, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie ```j``` has a size ```s[j]```. If ```s[j] >= g[i]```, we can assign the cookie ```j``` to the child ```i```, and the child ```i``` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
