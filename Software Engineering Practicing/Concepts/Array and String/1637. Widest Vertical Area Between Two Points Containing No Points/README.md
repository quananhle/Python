## [1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
