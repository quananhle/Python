## 88. Merge Sorted Array

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Easy

You are given two integer arrays ```nums1``` and ```nums2```, sorted in __non-decreasing__ order, and two integers ```m``` and ```n```, representing the number of elements in ```nums1``` and ```nums2``` respectively.

__Merge__ ```nums1``` and ```nums2``` into a single array sorted in __non-decreasing__ order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array ```nums1```_. To accommodate this, ```nums1``` has a length of ```m + n```, where the first ```m``` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last ```n``` elements are set to ```0``` and should be ignored. ```nums2``` has a length of ```n```.
