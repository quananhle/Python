## [1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero)

```Tag```: ```Bitwise Manipulation```

#### Difficulty: Hard

Given an integer ```n```, you must transform it into ```0``` using the following operations any number of times:

- Change the rightmost ($0^{th}$) bit in the binary representation of ```n```.
- Change the $i^{th}$ bit in the binary representation of ```n``` if the $(i-1)^{th}$ bit is set to ```1``` and the $(i-2)^{th}$ through $0^{th}$ bits are set to ```0```.

Return _the minimum number of operations to transform ```n``` into ```0```_.
