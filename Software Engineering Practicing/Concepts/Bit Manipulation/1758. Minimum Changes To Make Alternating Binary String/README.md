## [1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-changes-to-make-alternating-binary-string)

```Tag```: ```Bit Manipulation``` ```Array & String``` ```Simulation```

#### Difficulty: Easy

You are given a string ```s``` consisting only of the characters ```'0'``` and ```'1'```. In one operation, you can change any ```'0'``` to ```'1'``` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string ```"010"``` is alternating, while the string ```"0100"``` is not.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to make ```s``` alternating_.

---

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = "0100"
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already alternating.
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: s = "1111"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
```

__Constraints:__

- $1 \le s.length \le 10^4$
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'0'``` or ```'1'```.
