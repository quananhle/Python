## 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

```Tag```: ```Heap```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Design a class to find the k<sup>th</sup> largest element in a stream. Note that it is the k<sup>th</sup> largest element in the sorted order, not the k<sup>th</sup> distinct element.

Implement ```KthLargest``` class:

- ```KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)``` Initializes the object with the integer ```k``` and the stream of integers nums.
- ```int add(int val)``` Appends the integer ```val``` to the stream and returns the element representing the k<sup>th</sup> largest element in the stream.
