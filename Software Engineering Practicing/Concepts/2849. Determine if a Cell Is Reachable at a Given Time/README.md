## [2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-a-cell-is-reachable-at-a-given-time)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given four integers ```sx```, ```sy```, ```fx```, ```fy```, and a non-negative integer ```t```.

In an infinite 2D grid, you start at the cell ```(sx, sy)```. Each second, you must move to any of its adjacent cells.

Return _```true``` if you can reach cell ```(fx, fy)``` after exactly ```t``` seconds, or ```false``` otherwise_.

A cell's adjacent cells are the 8 cells around it that share at least one corner with it. You can visit the same cell several times.
