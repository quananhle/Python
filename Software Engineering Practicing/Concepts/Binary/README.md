## Binary Search Tree

A ```binary search tree``` (BST), a special form of a binary tree, satisfies the binary search property:

- The value in each node must be ```greater than``` (or equal to) any values stored in its left subtree.
- The value in each node must be ```less than``` (or equal to) any values stored in its right subtree.
