## Binary Search

### 3 Parts of a Successful Binary Search

__Binary Search__ is generally composed of 3 main sections:

- __Pre-processing__ - Sort if collection is unsorted.
- __Binary Search__ - Using a loop or recursion to divide search space in half after each comparison.
- __Post-processing__ - Determine viable candidates in the remaining space.

3 Templates for Binary Search

When we first learned Binary Search, we might struggle. We might study hundreds of Binary Search problems online and each time we looked at a developer's code, it seemed to be implemented slightly differently. Although each implementation divided the problem space in 1/2 at each step, one had numerous questions:

Why was it implemented slightly differently?

What was the developer thinking?

Which way was easier?

Which way is better?

After many failed attempts and lots of hair-pulling, we found 3 main templates for Binary Search. To prevent hair-pulling and to make it easier for new developers to learn and understand, we have provided them in the next chapter.
