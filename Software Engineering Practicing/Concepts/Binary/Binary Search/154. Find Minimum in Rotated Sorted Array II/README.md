## [154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii)

```Tag```: ```Binary Search```

#### Difficulty: Hard

Suppose an array of length ```n``` sorted in ascending order is rotated between ```1``` and ```n``` times. For example, the array ```nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]``` might become:

- ```[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]``` if it was rotated ```4``` times.
- ```[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]``` if it was rotated ```7``` times.

Notice that __rotating__ an array ```[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]``` ```1``` time results in the array ```[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]```.

Given the sorted rotated array ```nums``` that may contain duplicates, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
