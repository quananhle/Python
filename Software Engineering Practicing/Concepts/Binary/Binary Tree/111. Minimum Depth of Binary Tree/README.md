## [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree)

```Tag```: ```Binary Tree``` ```Depth-First Search``` ```Breadth-First Search```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
