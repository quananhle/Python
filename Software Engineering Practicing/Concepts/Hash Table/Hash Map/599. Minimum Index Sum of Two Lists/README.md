```Tag```: ```Hash Map```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given two arrays of strings ```list1``` and ```list2```, find the __common strings with the least index sum__.

A __common string__ is a string that appeared in both ```list1``` and ```list2```.

A __common string with the least index sum__ is a common string such that if it appeared at ```list1[i]``` and ```list2[j]``` then ```i + j``` should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.
