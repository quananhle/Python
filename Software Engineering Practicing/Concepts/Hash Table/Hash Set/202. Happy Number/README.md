## 202. Happy Number

```Tag```: ```Hash Set```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Write an algorithm to determine if a number ```n``` is happy.

A __happy number__ is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it __loops endlessly in a cycle__ which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return _```true``` if n is a happy number, and ```false``` if not_.
