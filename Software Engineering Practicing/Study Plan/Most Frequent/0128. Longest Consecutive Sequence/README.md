__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

__Constraints:__

- $0 \le nums.length \le 10^5$
- $-10^9 \le nums[i] \le 10^9$
