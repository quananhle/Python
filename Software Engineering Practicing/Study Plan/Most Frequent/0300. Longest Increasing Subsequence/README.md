__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

__Constraints:__

- $1 \le nums.length \le 2500$
- $-10^4 \le nums[i] \le 10^4$
