```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

__Constraints:__

- $n == height.length$
- $1 \le n \le 2 * 10^{4}$
- $0 \le height[i] \le 10^{5}$
