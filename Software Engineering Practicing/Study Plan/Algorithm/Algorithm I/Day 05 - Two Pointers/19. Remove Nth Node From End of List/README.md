```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

__Constraints:__

- The number of nodes in the list is ```sz```.
- ```1 <= sz <= 30```
- ```0 <= Node.val <= 100```
- ```1 <= n <= sz```

### Two Pointers

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Given two nodes, left and right, with a distane between two nodes always maintained at n
        size = 0
        node, curr = head, head
        
        # Calculate the size
        while node:
            node = node.next
            size += 1
        
        # Delete the only node
        if size == 1:
            head = None
            return head
        
        # Delte the first node
        if size == n:
            head = head.next
            return head

        # Traverse to (n + 1)th node    
        k = size - n
        while k > 1:
            curr = curr.next
            k -= 1
        
        curr.next = curr.next.next
        return head
```

            size += 1
        
        # Edge cases: head = [1, 2], n = 2, head = [1], n = 1
        if size == n:
            # Delte the first node or the only node
            return head.next

        prev, curr = head, head.next
        # Walk to the nth node from the end of the list   
        k = size - n - 1
        while k:
            curr = curr.next
            prev = prev.next
            k -= 1
        
        prev.next = curr.next
        return head
