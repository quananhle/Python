## [1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-submatrices-that-sum-to-target)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Hard

Given a matrix and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.

A submatrix x1, y1, x2, y2 is the set of all cells matrix[x][y] with x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.

Two submatrices (x1, y1, x2, y2) and (x1', y1', x2', y2') are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if x1 != x1'.
