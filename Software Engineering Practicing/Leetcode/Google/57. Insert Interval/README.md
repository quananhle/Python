## 57. Insert Interval

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals ```intervals``` where ```intervals[i]``` = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>] represent the start and the end of the i<sup>th</sup> interval and ```intervals``` is sorted in ascending order by start<sub>i</sub>. You are also given an interval ```newInterval = [start, end]``` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert ```newInterval``` into ```intervals``` such that ```intervals``` is still sorted in ascending order by start<sub>i</sub> and ```intervals``` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return _```intervals``` after the insertion_.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
 

Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
newInterval.length == 2
0 <= start <= end <= 105
