## [1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given an undirected weighted graph of ```n``` nodes __(0-indexed)__, represented by an edge list where ```edges[i] = [a, b]``` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes ```a``` and ```b``` with a probability of success of traversing that edge ```succProb[i]```.

Given two nodes ```start``` and ```end```, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from ```start``` to ```end``` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from ```start``` to ```end```, return ```0```. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most __1e-5__.
