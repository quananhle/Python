## [920. Number of Music Playlists](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists)

```Tag```: ```Dynamic Programming``` ```Math```

#### Difficulty: Hard

Your music player contains ```n``` different songs. You want to listen to ```goal``` songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played at least once.
- A song can only be played again only if ```k``` other songs have been played.

Given ```n```, ```goal```, and ```k```, return _the number of possible playlists that you can create_. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo ```10^9 + 7```.
