## [2366. Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-replacements-to-sort-the-array/)

```Tag```: ``````

#### Difficulty: Hard

You are given a __0-indexed__ integer array ```nums```. In one operation you can replace any element of the array with any two elements that sum to it.

- For example, consider ```nums = [5,6,7]```. In one operation, we can replace ```nums[1]``` with ```2``` and ```4``` and convert ```nums``` to ```[5,2,4,7]```.

Return _the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in non-decreasing order_.
