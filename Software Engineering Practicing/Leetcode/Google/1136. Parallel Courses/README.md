You are given an integer ```n```, which indicates that there are ```n``` courses labeled from ```1``` to ```n```. You are also given an array relations where ```relations[i]``` = $[prevCourse_{i}, nextCourse_{i}]$, representing a prerequisite relationship between course $prevCourse_{i}$ and course $nextCourse_{i}$: course $prevCourse_{i}$ has to be taken before course $nextCourse_{i}$.

In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semester for the courses you are taking.

Return _the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses_. If there is no way to take all the courses, return ```-1```.
