#### Difficulty: Easy

```
Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.
```
```
__Example 1:__

Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```
```
__Example 2:__

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 ```

__Constraints:__
```
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
0 <= nums[i] <= 5000
```
