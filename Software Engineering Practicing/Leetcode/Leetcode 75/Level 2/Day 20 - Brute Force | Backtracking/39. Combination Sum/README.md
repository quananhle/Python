## [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

```Tag```: ```Backtracking```

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an array of __distinct__ integers ```candidates``` and a target integer ```target```, return _a list of all __unique combinations__ of ```candidates``` where the chosen numbers sum to ```target```_. You may return the combinations in any order.

The __same__ number may be chosen from ```candidates``` an __unlimited number of times__. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to ```target``` is less than ```150``` combinations for the given input.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

__Constraints:__

- ```1 <= candidates.length <= 30```
- ```2 <= candidates[i] <= 40```
- ```All elements of ```candidates``` are distinct.
- ```1 <= target <= 40```

### Backtracking

__Complexity Analysis__:

Let N be the number of candidates, T be the target value, and M be the minimal value among the candidates.

__Time Complexity__: O(N<sup>T/M + 1</sup>), the execution of the backtracking is unfolded as a DFS traversal in a N-ary tree. The total number of steps during the backtracking would be the number of nodes in the tree. The maximal number of nodes in N-ary tree of ```T/M``` height would be N<sup>T/M + 1</sup>

__Space Complexity__: O(<sup>T/M</sup>), The number of recursive calls can pile up to ```T/M```, where we keep on adding the smallest element to the combination

```Python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = list()

        def backtrack(combinations, remaining, curr):
            # Base case
            if remaining == 0:
                res.append(combinations[:])
                return
            elif remaining < 0:
                return
            
            for i in range(curr, len(candidates)):
                combinations.append(candidates[i])
                # Stay in the same number until base cases reached
                backtrack(combinations, remaining - candidates[i], i)
                # Backtrack
                combinations.pop()

        backtrack([], target, 0)
        return res
```
