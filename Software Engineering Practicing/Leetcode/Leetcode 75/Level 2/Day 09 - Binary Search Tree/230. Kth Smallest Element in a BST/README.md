```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        stack = list()
        count = k
        
        while stack or root:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            root = stack.pop()
            if count == 1:
                break
            count -= 1
            root = root.right

        return root.val
```

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = val

### Recursive Inorder Traversal

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        def inorder(node):
            return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right) if node else []
        
        return inorder(root)[k - 1]
```

__Follow up__: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

That's a design question, basically we're asked to implement a structure which contains a BST inside and optimises the following operations :

- Insert

- Delete

- Find k<sup>th</sup> smallest

A double linked list would provide:

- ```O(H)``` time for the insert and delete.

- ```O(k)``` for the search of kth smallest.

The overall time complexity for insert/delete + search of k<sup>th</sup> smallest is ```O(H + k)``` instead of O(2H + k)

- __Time complexity__ for insert/delete + search of kth smallest: ```O(H + k)```, where ```H``` is a tree height. ```O(log‚Å°N + k)``` in the average case, ```O(N + k)``` in the worst case.
- __Space complexity__: ```O(N)``` to keep the linked list.
