## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A __valid BST__ is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys __less than__ the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
