## 62. Unique Paths

#### Difficulty: Medium

There is a robot on an ```m x n``` grid. The robot is initially located at the __top-left corner__ (i.e., ```grid[0][0]```). The robot tries to move to the __bottom-right corner__ (i.e., ```grid[m - 1][n - 1]```). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers ```m``` and ```n```, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to ```2 * 109```
