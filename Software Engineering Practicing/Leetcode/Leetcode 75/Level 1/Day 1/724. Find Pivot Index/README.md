## 724. Find Pivot Index

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given an array of integers ```nums```, calculate the __pivot index__ of this array.

The __pivot index__ is the index where the sum of all the numbers __strictly__ to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers __strictly__ to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is ```0``` because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the __leftmost pivot index__. If no such index exists, return ```-1```.
