## 200. Number of Islands

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an ```m x n``` 2D binary grid ```grid``` which represents a map of ```'1'```s (land) and ```'0'```s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
