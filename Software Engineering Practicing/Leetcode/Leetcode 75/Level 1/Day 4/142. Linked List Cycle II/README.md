## 142. Linked List Cycle II

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given the ```head``` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return ```null```_.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the ```next``` pointer. Internally, ```pos``` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's ```next``` pointer is connected to __(0-indexed)__. It is ```-1``` if there is no cycle. __Note that__ ```pos``` __is not passed as a parameter__.

__Do not modify__ the linked list.
