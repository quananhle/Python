Given a string ```s``` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the __longest palindrome__ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are __case sensitive__, for example, ```"Aa"``` is not considered a palindrome here.

Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```
