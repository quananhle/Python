## 392. Is Subsequence

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given two strings ```s``` and ```t```, return ```true``` if ```s``` is a __subsequence__ of ```t```, or ```false``` otherwise.

A __subsequence__ of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ```"ace"``` is a __subsequence__ of ```"abcde"``` while ```"aec"``` is not).

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

__Constraints:__
```
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
```
