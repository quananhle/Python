## 205. Isomorphic Strings

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given two strings ```s``` and ```t```, determine if they are _isomorphic_.

Two strings ```s``` and ```t``` are _isomorphic_ if the characters in ```s``` can be replaced to get ```t```.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
 
__Constraints:__
```
1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
```
