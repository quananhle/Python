## 299. Bulls and Cows

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are playing the __Bulls and Cows__ game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number ```secret``` and your friend's guess ```guess```, return the _hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as ```"xAyB"```, where ```x``` is the number of bulls and ```y``` is the number of cows. Note that both ```secret``` and ```guess``` may contain duplicate digits.
