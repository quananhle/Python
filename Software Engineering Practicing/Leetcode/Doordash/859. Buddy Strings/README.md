## [859. Buddy Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings/)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given two strings ```s``` and ```goal```, return _```true``` if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to ```goal```_, otherwise, return ```false```.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices ```i``` and ```j``` (0-indexed) such that ```i != j``` and swapping the characters at ```s[i]``` and ```s[j]```.

For example, swapping at indices ```0``` and ```2``` in ```"abcd"``` results in ```"cbad"```.
