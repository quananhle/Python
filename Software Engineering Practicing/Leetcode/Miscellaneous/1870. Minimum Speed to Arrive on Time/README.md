## [1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-speed-to-arrive-on-time/)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given a floating-point number ```hour```, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take ```n``` trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array ```dist``` of length ```n```, where ```dist[i]``` describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ```i```<sup>th</sup> train ride.

Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.

- For example, if the 1<sup>st</sup> train ride takes ```1.5``` hours, you must wait for an additional ```0.5``` hours before you can depart on the 2<sup>nd</sup> train ride at the 2 hour mark.

Return _the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or ```-1``` if it is impossible to be on time._

Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed ```10```<sup>7</sup> and ```hour``` will have at most two digits after the decimal point.
