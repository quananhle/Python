## [439. Ternary Expression Parser](https://leetcode.com/problems/ternary-expression-parser/)

```Tag```: 

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given a string ```expression``` representing arbitrarily nested ternary expressions, evaluate the expression, and return the result of it.

You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only contains digits, ```'?'```, ```':'```, ```'T'```, and ```'F'``` where ```'T'``` is true and ```'F'``` is false. All the numbers in the expression are one-digit numbers (i.e., in the range ```[0, 9]```).

The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages), and the result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit, ```'T'``` or ```'F'```.
