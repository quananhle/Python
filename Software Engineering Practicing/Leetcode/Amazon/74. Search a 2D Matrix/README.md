## [74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

```Tag```: ```Matrix```

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given an ```m x n``` integer matrix ```matrix``` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer ```target```, return _```true``` if ```target``` is in ```matrix``` or ```false``` otherwise_.

You must write a solution in $\mathcal{O}(\log(m \cdot n))$ time complexity.
