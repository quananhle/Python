__Example 1:__
```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

__Constraints:__

- ```m == grid.length```
- ```n == grid[i].length```
- ```1 <= m, n <= 100```
- ```-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100```
