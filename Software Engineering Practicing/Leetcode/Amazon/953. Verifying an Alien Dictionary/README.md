## 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

```Tag```: ```Hash Map```

#### Difficulty: Easy

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of ```words``` written in the alien language, and the ```order``` of the alphabet, return _```true``` iff the given ```words``` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language_.
