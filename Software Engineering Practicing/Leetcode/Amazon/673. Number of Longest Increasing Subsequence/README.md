__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
```

__Constraints:__

- ```1 <= nums.length <= 2000```
- ```-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6```
