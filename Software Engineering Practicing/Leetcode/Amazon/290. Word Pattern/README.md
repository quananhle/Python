## 290. Word Pattern

```Tag```: ```Hash Table```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given a ```pattern``` and a string ```s```, find if ```s``` follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in ```pattern``` and a __non-empty word__ in ```s```.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
``

__Example 3:__

```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

__Constraints:__

```
1 <= pattern.length <= 300
pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
1 <= s.length <= 3000
s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.
