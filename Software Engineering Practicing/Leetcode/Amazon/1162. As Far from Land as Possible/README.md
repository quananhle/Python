## 1162. As Far from Land as Possible

```Tag```: ```Breadth-First Search``` ```Dynamic Programming```

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an ```n x n``` grid containing only values ```0``` and ```1```, where ```0``` represents water and ```1``` represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return _the distance_. If no land or water exists in the grid, return ```-1```.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells ```(x0, y0)``` and ```(x1, y1)``` is ```|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|```.
