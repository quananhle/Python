## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

#### Difficulty: Easy

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a __leaf value sequence__.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is ```(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)```.

Two binary trees are considered _leaf-similar_ if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return ```true``` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes ```root1``` and ```root2``` are leaf-similar.
