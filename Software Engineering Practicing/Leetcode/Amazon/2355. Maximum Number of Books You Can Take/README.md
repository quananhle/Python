## [2355. Maximum Number of Books You Can Take](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-books-you-can-take)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Hard

You are given a __0-indexed__ integer array ```books``` of length ```n``` where ```books[i]``` denotes the number of books on the i<sup>th</sup> shelf of a bookshelf.

You are going to take books from a contiguous section of the bookshelf spanning from ```l``` to ```r``` where $0 \le l \le r \lt n```. For each index ```i``` in the range $l \le i \lt r$, you must take strictly fewer books from shelf ```i``` than shelf ```i + 1```.

Return _the __maximum__ number of books you can take from the bookshelf_.
