## 20. Valid Parentheses

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given a string ```s``` containing just the characters ```'('```, ```')'```, ```'{'```, ```'}'```, ```'['``` and ```']'```, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
