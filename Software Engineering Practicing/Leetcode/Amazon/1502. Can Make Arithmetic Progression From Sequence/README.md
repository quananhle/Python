## [1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-arithmetic-progression-from-sequence)

```Tag```: ```Array & String``` ```Sorting```

#### Difficulty: Easy

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers ```arr```, return _```true``` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression_. Otherwise, return ```false```.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
```

__Constraints:__

- ```2 <= arr.length <= 1000```
- ```-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6```
