## [847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes)

```Tag```: ```Graph```

#### Difficulty: Hard

You have an undirected, connected graph of ```n``` nodes labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1```. You are given an array ```graph``` where ```graph[i]``` is a list of all the nodes connected with node ```i``` by an edge.

Return _the length of the shortest path that visits every node_. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
