## 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given two strings ```text1``` and ```text2```, return _the length of their __longest common subsequence___. If there is no __common subsequence__, return ```0```.

A __subsequence__ of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, ```"ace"``` is a subsequence of ```"abcde"```.

A __common subsequence__ of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
