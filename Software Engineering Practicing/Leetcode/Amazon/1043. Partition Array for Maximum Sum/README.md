## [1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-sum)

```Tag```: ```Dynamic Programming```

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an integer array ```arr```, partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most ```k```. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return _the largest sum of the given array after partitioning_. Test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3
Output: 84
Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4
Output: 83
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: arr = [1], k = 1
Output: 1
```

__Constraints:__

- $1 \le arr.length \le 500$
- $0 \le arr[i] \le 10^9$
- $1 \le k \le arr.length$
