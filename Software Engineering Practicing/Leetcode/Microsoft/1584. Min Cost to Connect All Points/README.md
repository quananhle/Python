## [1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given an array ```points``` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where ```points[i]``` = $[x_{i}, y_{i}]$.

The cost of connecting two points $[x_{i}, y_{i}]$ and $[x_{i}, y_{i}]$ is the __manhattan distance__ between them: $|x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|$, where ```|val|``` denotes the absolute value of ```val```.

Return _the minimum cost to make all points connected_. All points are connected if there is __exactly one__ simple path between any two points.
