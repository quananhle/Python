## [1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/)

```Tag```: 

#### Difficulty: Medium

Given an array ```nums``` of integers, return _the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in ```nums```_.

Note that:

- A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- A sequence ```seq``` is arithmetic if ```seq[i + 1] - seq[i]``` are all the same value (for ```0 <= i < seq.length - 1```).
