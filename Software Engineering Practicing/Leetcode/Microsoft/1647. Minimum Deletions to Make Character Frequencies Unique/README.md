## [1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique)

 ```Tag```:

 #### Difficulty: Medium

 A string ```s``` is called good if there are no two different characters in ```s``` that have the same frequency.

Given a string ```s```, return _the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make ```s``` good_.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string ```"aab"```, the frequency of ```'a'``` is ```2```, while the frequency of ```'b'``` is ```1```.
