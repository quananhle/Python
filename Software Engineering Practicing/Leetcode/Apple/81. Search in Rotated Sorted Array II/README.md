## [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii)

```Tag```: ```Binary Search```

#### Difficulty: Medium

There is an integer array ```nums``` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, ```nums``` is rotated at an unknown pivot index ```k``` ```(0 <= k < nums.length)``` such that the resulting array is ```[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]``` __(0-indexed)__. For example, ```[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]``` might be rotated at pivot index ```5``` and become ```[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]```.

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return _```true``` if ```target``` is in ```nums```, or ```false``` if it is not in ```nums```_.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
