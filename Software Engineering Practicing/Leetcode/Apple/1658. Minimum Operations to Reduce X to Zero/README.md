## [1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

You are given an integer array ```nums``` and an integer ```x```. In one operation, you can either remove the ```leftmost``` or the ```rightmost``` element from the array ```nums``` and subtract its value from ```x```. Note that this modifies the array for future operations.

Return _the minimum number of operations to reduce ```x``` to exactly ```0``` if it is possible_, otherwise, return ```-1```.
