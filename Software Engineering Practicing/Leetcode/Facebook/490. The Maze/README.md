## [490. The Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Medium

There is a ball in a ```maze``` with empty spaces (represented as ```0```) and walls (represented as ```1```). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ```m x n``` maze, the ball's ```start``` position and the destination, where ```start = [startrow, startcol]``` and ```destination = [destinationrow, destinationcol]```, return _```true``` if the ball can stop at the destination, otherwise return ```false```_.

You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).
