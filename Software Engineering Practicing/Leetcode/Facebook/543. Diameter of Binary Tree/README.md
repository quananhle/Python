```Tag```: ```Binary Tree``` ```Depth-First Search```

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, return _the length of the diameter of the tree_.

The __diameter__ of a binary __tree__ is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The __length__ of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
